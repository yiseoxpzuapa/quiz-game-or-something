# so like this was. thing made for my friends just a little funny silly goof

uh i think you need python to run it:


how to run

# step 1: open python terminal in the folder where the stuff is
# step 2: run command: `python base.py`

yay
if you dont have python its on their website and microsoft store

# if that doesnt work for u then i did these steps to get it running
install python extension on VSCode IDE
once built, went to TERMINAL/PS and ran `python base.py`
